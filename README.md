## About QuaPan
Quapan is a quantum computing simulator for educational use.
Grover algorithm is implemented in a directory of "algorithms".

## Download 
Tag v1.0 is to simulate Grover algorithm.
```
git clone https://github.com/Alaska-Panda/QuaPan.git - b v1.0 --depth 1
```

## Test
Execute Grover algotithm to search Kth data in database represented by N Qubits. \
Here is an example with parameters of N = 4 and K = 7.
```
cd algorithms
python3 auto_grover.py 4 7 1 
```
