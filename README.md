## About QuaPan
It is a quantum computing simulator for an educational use.
Grover algorithm is implemented in a repository of "algorithms".

## Download 
My repository at tag v1.0 is to simulate a grover algorithm.
```
git clone git@github.com:Alaska-Panda/QuaPan.git - b v1.0 --depth 1
```

## Test
Execute grover algotithm to find Kth data in database represented by N Qubits. 
Here is an example with N = 4 and K = 7.
```
cd algorithms
python3 auto_grover.py 4 7 1 
```
